# 📝 NLP Getting Started

A comprehensive notebook exploring text classification techniques using various NLP models. The project covers data visualization, feature engineering, and multiple deep learning approaches.

## 📂 Project Overview

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Visualizing text data effectively  
  - Creating embeddings for better feature representation  
  - Implementing a `TextVectorization` layer for efficient text processing  

- **Models Applied:**  
  - `Model 0` – Naive Bayes (Baseline)  
  - `Model 1` – Simple Dense Neural Network  
  - `Model 2` – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  
  - `Model 3` – Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)  
  - `Model 4` – Bidirectional RNN  

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Each model is evaluated based on the following key performance indicators:

- **Accuracy**  
- **Precision**  
- **Recall**  
- **F1 Score**
