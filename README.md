# NLP Getting Started 🚀
This repository contains a comprehensive notebook on natural language processing (NLP), covering essential steps to process and analyze text data effectively.

## Key Highlights 📊
Data Visualization: Exploratory data analysis to understand text distribution and insights.
Embeddings: Generating meaningful numerical representations of text.
TextVectorization Layer: Implementing TensorFlow's TextVectorization layer for efficient preprocessing.

## Models Implemented 🏗️
I have applied and evaluated five different models to compare performance:

Model 0: Naive Bayes (Baseline)
Model 1: Simple Dense Neural Network
Model 2: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Model 3: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
Model 4: Bidirectional RNN

## Evaluation Metrics 📈
Each model's performance is assessed using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
